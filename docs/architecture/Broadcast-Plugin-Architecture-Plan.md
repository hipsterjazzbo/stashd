# Broadcast Plugin Architecture — Implementation Plan

## Status (2026-07-01)

**Phase 1 is done, in-tree, under `app/Broadcasts/Plugins/`.** `BroadcastPlugin`,
`#[StashdBroadcast]`, `BroadcastPluginDiscoverer`, `BroadcastPluginRegistry`,
`FileKind`, `UiControl`, and `DiscoveredPlugin` all exist and are wired into
`BroadcastController` and `BroadcastLifecycleService`; the old `BroadcastType`
enum, `BroadcastTypeRegistry`, `BroadcastFormat` interface, and `Formats/`
directory are deleted. `GET /api/v1/broadcast-plugins` exposes the registry to
the UI, which drives its create-broadcast dropdown from it.

**Phases 2-3 (separate `stashd/plugin-podcast` / `stashd/plugin-media-server`
Composer packages, `bootstrap.php`) are deferred, not scheduled.** This
contradicts the repo rule "v1 is plugin-ready but does not ship a third-party
plugin runtime" (`.claude/rules/stashd-architecture.md`). Plugins stay in-tree
under `app/Broadcasts/Plugins/`, discovered the same way — the packaging
boundary was never actually needed for a single-binary self-hosted app; revisit
only if a real third-party plugin ecosystem becomes a goal.

**Update (2026-07-02): `FilesystemBroadcastPlugin` removed.** It was a bare
series layout with no NFO sidecars and no media-server targeting — unclear
value next to `JellyfinBroadcastPlugin`/`PlexBroadcastPlugin`, so it's gone.
The plugin registry now has three keys: `podcast`, `jellyfin`, `plex`. Any
mention of a `filesystem` broadcast type below is historical record of what
the original migration produced, not current state.

The sections below are the **original plan as written**, kept for the design
rationale, with corrections inline where the actual implementation ended up
different (marked **✅ implemented differently** or **⏸ deferred**). Do not
copy code samples from here without checking the real source first — several
signatures below don't match what shipped.

## Goal

~~Extract the broadcast format layer from core into separate Composer
packages.~~ **✅ implemented differently**: the format layer was extracted from
the old enum/registry into a plugin interface + attribute-discovery system,
but it stays in-tree (`app/Broadcasts/Plugins/`) rather than moving to separate
Composer packages. Core (`BroadcastController`, `BroadcastLifecycleService`)
now goes through `BroadcastPluginRegistry`/`BroadcastPlugin` instead of
hardcoding format classes, which was the actual goal — package boundaries were
never the point.

## Original "Current State" (pre-migration — all deleted now)

- `BroadcastType` enum: `FilesystemSeries`, `JellyfinSeries`, `PlexSeries`, `Podcast`
- `BroadcastTypeRegistry` — holds instances of format classes, resolves by enum value
- `BroadcastFormat` interface — `key()`, `plan()`, `publish()`, `verify()`, `prune()`
- `AbstractSeriesBroadcastType` — shared base for series formats (NFO, hardlinks, sidecars)
- `PodcastBroadcastFormat` — RSS feed generation, tokenized URLs, asset selection
- `BroadcastController` — hardcodes `BroadcastType` enum, `PodcastTokenService`, `PodcastEpisodeUrlBuilder`
- `BroadcastLifecycleService` — uses `BroadcastTypeRegistry` to resolve handlers

## Target State

- `BroadcastPlugin` interface (replaces `BroadcastFormat`) — ✅ done
- `#[StashdBroadcast]` attribute for discovery — ✅ done
- `BroadcastPluginDiscoverer` — scans Tempest discovery at boot — ✅ done
- ~~`stashd/plugin-podcast` — Composer package~~ — ⏸ deferred, stays in-tree as `PodcastBroadcastPlugin`
- ~~`stashd/plugin-media-server` — Composer package~~ — ⏸ deferred, stays in-tree as `JellyfinBroadcastPlugin`/`PlexBroadcastPlugin`/`FilesystemBroadcastPlugin`
- ~~Core has zero knowledge of plugin internals~~ — not fully true even as designed: `BroadcastController` still special-cases `'podcast'` for feed URLs/token rotation, same as before

## Core Interfaces (actual, as implemented — corrects the original draft below)

### `BroadcastPlugin` (interface) — `app/Broadcasts/BroadcastPlugin.php`

```php
interface BroadcastPlugin
{
    public function broadcastKeys(): array;
    public function supportedFileKinds(): array;
    public function uiControls(): array;
    public function plan(BroadcastContext $context): BroadcastPlan;
    public function publish(BroadcastContext $context, BroadcastPlan $plan): BroadcastPublishResult;
    public function verify(BroadcastContext $context): BroadcastVerifyResult;
    public function prune(BroadcastContext $context): BroadcastPruneResult;
}
```

Note the real `plan()` takes **no `$userInput` parameter** — the draft below is
wrong on this point. Per-broadcast settings (e.g. podcast `media_kind`) are read
from `BroadcastContext`/`BroadcastRecord.settings`, not passed into `plan()`.

### `StashdBroadcast` (attribute) — `app/Broadcasts/StashdBroadcast.php`

```php
#[Attribute(Attribute::TARGET_CLASS)]
final readonly class StashdBroadcast
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public string $description = '',
    ) {}
}
```

Applied as: `#[StashdBroadcast('Podcast', 'RSS podcast feed with episode media URLs.')]`
— **no `$key` argument**. The broadcast key(s) come from the plugin's own
`broadcastKeys()` method instead, since a single plugin class can register more
than one key.

### `DiscoveredPlugin` (wrapper) — `app/Broadcasts/DiscoveredPlugin.php`

```php
final readonly class DiscoveredPlugin
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $className,
        public string $name,
        public string $description,
        public array $broadcastKeys,
        public BroadcastPlugin $plugin,
    ) {}
}
```

### `BroadcastPluginDiscoverer` (service) — `app/Broadcasts/BroadcastPluginDiscoverer.php`

Scans Tempest discovery registrations at boot, finds all `#[StashdBroadcast]` attributes, instantiates plugins, validates no duplicate keys, populates the static `BroadcastPluginRegistry` (not returned as a value — the draft below implies a return value, but discovery is a boot-time side effect via Tempest's `Discovery` interface).

### `FileKind` (enum)

```php
enum FileKind: string { case Video = 'video'; case Audio = 'audio'; }
```

### `UiControl` (value object) — `app/Broadcasts/UiControl.php`

```php
final readonly class UiControl
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public string $label,
        public string $type = 'text',   // e.g. 'text', 'select'
        public mixed $default = null,
        public array $options = [],      // for select: flat list of option values
    ) {}
}
```

No `$category` or `$required` — the draft below over-specified this. No plugin
currently declares any `uiControls()` beyond the podcast plugin's five text/select
fields (title, description, author, funding_url, media_kind); see
`GET /api/v1/broadcast-plugins` for the live shape.

## File Layout

### Core (`app/Broadcasts/`) — ✅ implemented, in-tree

The plugin implementations live under `app/Broadcasts/Plugins/`
(`JellyfinBroadcastPlugin`, `PlexBroadcastPlugin`,
`AbstractSeriesBroadcastPlugin` as their shared base, `SeriesFormatOptions`) and
`app/Broadcasts/Podcasts/` (podcast support classes — `PodcastAssetSelector`,
`PodcastTokenService`, `PodcastEpisodeUrlBuilder`, etc. — plus
`PodcastBroadcastPlugin` under `Plugins/`). `Formats/` is deleted, as planned;
`Podcasts/` was **not** deleted — it never moved to a separate package, so it
stays. Don't trust a hand-copied file tree here to stay accurate — run
`ls app/Broadcasts/ app/Broadcasts/Plugins/` for the current, authoritative
layout.

### `stashd/plugin-podcast`, `stashd/plugin-media-server` — ⏸ deferred, never created

These packages don't exist and aren't planned. Everything they would have
contained (`PodcastAssetSelector`, `PodcastTokenService`,
`JellyfinBroadcastPlugin`, `PlexBroadcastPlugin`,
`AbstractSeriesBroadcastPlugin`, `SeriesFormatOptions`, etc.) lives in-tree
under `app/Broadcasts/Podcasts/` and `app/Broadcasts/Plugins/` instead, per the
in-tree-only decision at the top of this doc.

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core interfaces and types — ✅ done

1. Create `BroadcastPlugin` interface
2. Create `StashdBroadcast` attribute
3. Create `DiscoveredPlugin` wrapper
4. Create `FileKind` enum
5. Create `UiControl` value object
6. Create `BroadcastPluginDiscoverer` service
7. Wire discoverer into Tempest discovery at boot

### Phase 2: Extract podcast plugin — ✅ implemented differently, in-tree (⏸ Composer package deferred)

The podcast format was extracted from `PodcastBroadcastFormat` into
`PodcastBroadcastPlugin` implementing `BroadcastPlugin`, `BroadcastType`/
`BroadcastTypeRegistry`/`BroadcastFormat`/`app/Broadcasts/Formats/` are deleted,
and `BroadcastController`/`BroadcastLifecycleService` resolve it through
`BroadcastPluginRegistry`. It was **not** moved to a `stashd/plugin-podcast`
Composer package — steps 1, 5, and 6 below (package skeleton, `bootstrap.php`,
Composer dependency) didn't happen and aren't planned.

1. ~~Create `stashd/plugin-podcast` package skeleton~~ — ⏸ deferred
2. Move `PodcastBroadcastFormat` → plugin (renamed to `PodcastBroadcastPlugin`, implements `BroadcastPlugin`) — ✅ done, in-tree
3. Move all podcast support classes → plugin — ✅ done, but to `app/Broadcasts/Podcasts/` in-tree, not a package
4. Add `#[StashdBroadcast]` to plugin class — ✅ done
5. ~~Create plugin `bootstrap.php` that registers Tempest discovery~~ — ⏸ deferred (discovery is Tempest's normal in-tree class scanning)
6. ~~Update core to depend on plugin via Composer~~ — ⏸ deferred
7. Update `BroadcastController` and `BroadcastLifecycleService` to use discovered plugins — ✅ done
8. Update `BroadcastType` enum — remove podcast, jellyfin, plex, filesystem values — ✅ done, but the whole enum was deleted rather than narrowed (broadcast type is a plain string now)
9. Delete `app/Broadcasts/Formats/` directory — ✅ done
10. ~~Delete `app/Broadcasts/Podcasts/` directory (moved to plugin)~~ — did not happen; this directory still holds the in-tree podcast support classes
11. Delete `BroadcastTypeRegistry` — ✅ done
12. Delete `AbstractSeriesBroadcastType` (plugin-internal) — ✅ done (replaced by `AbstractSeriesBroadcastPlugin`)
13. Delete `BroadcastFormat` interface (replaced by `BroadcastPlugin`) — ✅ done

### Phase 3: Extract media-server plugin — ✅ implemented differently, in-tree (⏸ Composer package deferred)

Same story as Phase 2: `JellyfinBroadcastPlugin`, `PlexBroadcastPlugin`, and
`FilesystemBroadcastPlugin` (all extending `AbstractSeriesBroadcastPlugin`)
exist under `app/Broadcasts/Plugins/`, each implementing `BroadcastPlugin`
directly — no separate `stashd/plugin-media-server` package, no
`bootstrap.php`, no Composer dependency.

### Phase 4: Wire and clean up — ✅ done (aside from the Composer-package items, which don't apply)

1. Update `BroadcastController` to use `BroadcastPluginDiscoverer` — ✅ done (via `BroadcastPluginRegistry`, which the discoverer populates)
2. Update `BroadcastLifecycleService` to call plugin methods directly — ✅ done
3. Update `BroadcastContextFactory` if needed — ✅ done
4. Update `BroadcastState` enum if any type-dependent states need removal — not needed; unchanged
5. Update tests — ✅ done for the in-tree scope; no separate per-package test suites since there are no packages
6. ~~Update `composer.json` to add plugin dependencies~~ — ⏸ deferred, not applicable
7. Update `docs/TODO.md` to reflect completion — see note below
8. Delete any remaining dead code — ✅ done (`BroadcastTypeTest.php` stubs, stray backup files, unused `app/Id/EntityId.php`)

### Phase 5: Documentation — partially done

1. Update `docs/TODO.md` with plugin architecture docs — check `docs/TODO.md` directly; not exhaustively re-verified here
2. Write plugin development guide (how to create a new plugin) — not done; would be worth writing before any real third-party plugin push, not needed for the current four in-tree plugins
3. Update `AGENTS.md` or architecture docs with new structure — this doc is that update

## Key Migration Details

### `BroadcastRecord.type` — enum to string — ✅ done, simpler than drafted

No SQL migration ever ran or was needed: `broadcasts.type` was already a plain
`string` SQLite column in `CreateDomainSchema` (this project is SQLite-only —
the drafted `ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT` is Postgres syntax and never
applied here). Only `BroadcastRecord::$type`'s PHP type changed, from
`BroadcastType $type` to plain `string $type` — an application-layer change
with zero migration surface.

### UI flow — ✅ implemented as drafted, minus `$userInput`

1. User creates broadcast → core queries the plugin registry (`GET /api/v1/broadcast-plugins`) → renders the type picker from it → user selects a type
2. Core passes the selected key to `BroadcastRepository::create()`; the plugin's `plan()` reads settings from `BroadcastContext`, not from a `plan()` argument (see the `$userInput` correction above)
3. Core calls `publish()` → plugin creates its output (RSS feed, Jellyfin layout, etc.)
4. Plugin returns `BroadcastPublishResult` with publication details

`uiControls()` is exposed over the API and the create form now renders
per-plugin controls from it (the podcast plugin's `title`/`description`/
`author`/`funding_url`; `media_kind` keeps its own dedicated select, excluded
from the generic render to avoid a duplicate). There is still no general
`PATCH` for broadcast settings after creation — `settings` can only be set at
creation time (`POST /api/v1/stashes/{id}/broadcasts`) or, for the one
settings key that has its own endpoint, via `PATCH /api/v1/broadcasts/{id}/
season-mapping`. Series plugins declare no `uiControls()`, so nothing renders
for them.

### Plugin bootstrap — ⏸ deferred, doesn't apply

No `bootstrap.php`, no Composer package dependency. Tempest's normal
`Discovery` scanning finds `#[StashdBroadcast]`-attributed classes anywhere
under `app/`, in-tree, the same way it discovers command handlers, job
handlers, and everything else in this codebase.

## Risks

- ~~Existing broadcasts with `BroadcastType::JellyfinSeries` values need migration to string~~ — moot; the column was always a string (see above), and no broadcasts existed yet when the enum was removed
- Tests that hardcode `BroadcastType` values need updating — done, but this exact category of drift (stale `filesystem_series`/`jellyfin_series`/`plex_series` keys) recurred three separate times after the initial migration (frontend, then two test files, then this doc's own `BroadcastType` schema in `docs/openapi.yaml`) before all instances were caught — a good argument for the `GET /api/v1/broadcast-plugins` endpoint and `docs/openapi.yaml`'s `BroadcastType` enum as the two remaining sources of truth to keep in sync if a plugin's key ever changes again
- Plugin discovery must handle missing plugins gracefully (log warning, skip) — done: `BroadcastPluginDiscoverer::apply()` logs and skips on resolution failure, missing `BroadcastPlugin` implementation, or duplicate key
- ~~Docker build needs plugin Composer packages available~~ — not applicable, no packages
- `BroadcastController` hardcodes `PodcastTokenService` and `PodcastEpisodeUrlBuilder` — still true today, unchanged from the original migration; core is not fully plugin-agnostic and isn't expected to be while packaging stays deferred
