/**
 * busy_timeout and foreign_keys are per-connection SQLite pragmas.
 * stashd:boot sets them on its own throwaway CLI connection at container
 * start, which doesn't carry over: classic-mode PHP opens a fresh connection
 * every request (no long-lived worker to configure once, unlike the old
 * RoadRunner bridge), so without this they'd silently be off/0ms on every
 * web request -- FK violations pass silently and SQLITE_BUSY surfaces as
 * "not found" under write contention. Priority forces this ahead of every
 * other middleware (including RequireAuthMiddleware, which queries the DB).
