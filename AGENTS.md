# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This is the canonical instruction file for AI coding agents working on **Stashd**.

Read it before planning or editing. Keep it concise and current; do not turn it into a second engineering specification.

This file is intended to work for Claude Code, Hermes/Ollama, Aider, Codex/Cursor-style agents, and future local or remote coding assistants.

- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` points here.
- Hermes/Ollama: `.hermes.md` points here and to the longer Hermes docs.
- Long reusable procedures belong in `.claude/skills/`.
- Long reference notes belong in `docs/ai/` or existing architecture docs.

## Project identity

**Stashd** is self-hosted media preservation infrastructure.

It saves online video/audio sources into a local **Vault** and exposes generated views through **Broadcasts** such as Jellyfin libraries, Plex libraries, and private podcast feeds.

Core model:

```text
Stash → Vault → Broadcasts
```

The product should feel like quietly competent homelab infrastructure: fast, reliable, private, understandable, and boring to run.

Stashd is not a YouTube frontend, not a recommendation engine, and not a media player.

## Current stack

- PHP `^8.5`
- Tempest Framework `^3.0`
- FrankenPHP application server (classic mode)
- SQLite for v1
- Pest for tests
- Laravel Pint with PSR-12 formatting
- `hazel/ytdlphp` wrapping `yt-dlp`
- Docker-first default deployment
- Default HTTP port: `8474`

## Required project instructions

Before planning, editing files, or running commands:

1. Enumerate every Markdown file under `.claude/rules/`.
2. Read all of those files in full.
3. Treat their contents as mandatory project instructions, not optional
   documentation.
4. Apply more specific rules over more general rules when they conflict.
5. Do not ask for permission merely to read these files.
6. If the directory or an individual rule file is absent, continue without it
   rather than interrupting the task.

These instructions apply to every task in this repository.

## Repo map

Important directories:

```text
app/Auth           Single-owner auth, users, API tokens
app/Broadcasts     Generated views: podcasts, Jellyfin/Plex, triggers
app/Commands       Command records, dispatch, command handlers

docs/              Product, architecture, provider, storage, runtime, AI docs
```

Always inspect existing code in the relevant domain before adding new patterns.

## Canonical docs

Use these docs as context when relevant:

```text
docs/Stashd-Engineering-Specification.md
docs/Stashd-Architecture-and-Vision-Updated.md
docs/Stashd-Branding-Plan.md
docs/Stashd-Browser-Extension-Spec.md
docs/TODO.md
docs/agent-context.md
docs/architecture/
docs/providers/
docs/storage/
docs/runtime/
docs/broadcasts/
docs/media-servers/
docs/foundation/
docs/ai/
```

Do not duplicate these docs in code comments or routine summaries. Link to or update them when a decision changes.

If present, `docs/ai/Stashd-Hermes-Agent-Reference.md` is long-form agent memory. Read only the relevant sections; do not load it reflexively for every small task.

## Operating principles

Prioritize:

1. Correct behavior.
2. Small, reviewable diffs.
3. Clear domain language.
4. Readable modern PHP.
5. Tempest-native patterns already present in the repo.
6. Tests for behavior changes.
7. Secret-safe logs, activity, jobs, command metadata, and public outputs.
8. Calm, dense, accessible UI/UX.
9. Docker runtime reliability.

Avoid:

- Clever abstractions.
- Large speculative rewrites.
- Framework cargo-culting from Laravel, Symfony, Rails, or Node apps.
- Vague names such as `Manager`, `Helper`, `Util`, `Processor`, `Data`, `Info`, or `Thing`.
- Generic methods named after the product, such as `stashd()`.
- Direct shelling out to `yt-dlp` from domain code.
- Raw URL strings leaking through domain internals when a URI/value object exists.
- Public-by-default behavior.
- Hidden filesystem or storage side effects.

## Non-negotiable architecture rules

- Feature-first layout under `app/`.
- Controllers validate/adapt HTTP only; no long-running synchronous controller work.
- Long-running work goes through commands/jobs.
- State changes go through `StateTransitionService`.
- Secrets go through `SecretsService`.
- Vault is canonical.
- Broadcasts are disposable/regeneratable views over Vault assets.
- Filesystem broadcasts are hardlink-first; do not silently copy when hardlinking is expected.
- Trigger failures are separate from broadcast file validity.
- ytdlphp is the only download/process boundary.
- SQLite DB columns use camelCase to match Tempest record properties.
- Public API JSON uses snake_case.
- Public/security-sensitive responses use explicit Resource DTOs/arrays; do not auto-serialize Tempest records directly.

## Security rules

Never expose or log:

- raw broadcast tokens
- raw item tokens
- secret ciphertext
- password hashes
- provider credentials
- media-server tokens
- internal filesystem paths in public XML/API unless intentionally designed and tested
- raw command/job payloads if they contain secrets/tokens

Podcast feed URLs use path tokens, not query tokens.

Invalid public-token routes should use non-revealing responses. Do not leak whether a broadcast/item exists.

## Agent modes and scope

### Claude Code / frontier coding agents

Use for broader but bounded slices, security-sensitive route/token work, lifecycle changes across controllers/commands/jobs/services/tests/docs, and larger refactors with a clear migration plan.

Even then:

- inspect local patterns first
- plan before broad edits
- keep diffs small
- stop when scope expands

### Hermes / local Ollama agents

Hermes/local models are useful but resource-constrained. Treat them as careful focused assistants, not autonomous architects.

Good tasks:

- selected-file review
- purpose-focused class docblocks
- small unit tests
- small DTO/resource cleanup
- naming/cohesion feedback
- explaining unfamiliar code
- narrow patches touching roughly 1-4 files

For broad/security-sensitive tasks, produce an audit/plan first rather than editing.

### Aider / terminal patch agents

Use for narrow git-aware patches against explicitly supplied files. Do not point a local model at the whole repo and ask for broad implementation.

## Before editing

For non-trivial tasks:

1. Check `git status --short`.
2. Identify unrelated worktree changes and leave them alone.
3. Inspect relevant existing files before inventing a pattern.
4. Summarize the existing local pattern.
5. Propose a short plan and likely files to change.
6. List checks/tests to run.
7. Wait for approval if the task is broad, risky, architectural, or security-sensitive.

For small obvious fixes, proceed directly but keep the diff minimal.

## After editing

Before claiming completion:

1. Run the narrowest relevant check first.
2. Run broader checks when the change justifies it.
3. Summarize files changed and why.
4. Explain how the change fits existing architecture.
5. List commands actually run.
6. State anything not run and why.
7. Note risks or follow-up work.

Never claim tests passed unless they were actually run and passed.

## Common commands

Use Composer scripts where available:

```bash
composer lint
composer format
composer test
composer test:unit
composer test:feature
composer test:parallel
composer test:docker-smoke
composer test:docker-smoke:no-build
```

For noisy output, prefer:

```bash
composer test 2>&1 | scripts/claude/trim-test-output.sh
```

Docker/runtime changes require inspecting:

```text
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
docker/
.env.example
tests/docker/
```

A build that passes unit tests but cannot boot reliably under Docker is not releasable.

## Lerd — Laravel Local Dev Environment

This project runs on **lerd**, a Podman-based Laravel development environment. The `lerd` MCP server is available — use it to manage the environment without leaving the chat.

The MCP surface is **eleven grouped tools**, each driven by an `action` argument: `site`, `service`, `db`, `env`, `runtime`, `worker`, `exec`, `framework`, `diag`, `logs`, `worktree`. Always pass `action`. Most actions also accept an optional `path` that defaults to the directory the assistant was opened in (then `LERD_SITE_PATH` if set), so you can usually omit it. Start by calling `site` with `action: "list"` to discover sites.

### Architecture

- PHP runs in Podman containers named `lerd-php<version>-fpm` (e.g. `lerd-php84-fpm`); each container includes composer and node/npm; the PHP version is resolved from `.lerd.yaml` → `.php-version` → `composer.json` `require.php` constraint (matched against installed versions) → global default
- Nginx routes `*.test` domains to the correct PHP-FPM container
- Services (MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.) and custom services run as Podman containers via systemd quadlets
- Node.js versions are managed by fnm; per-project version is set via a `.node-version` file
- Framework workers (queue, schedule, reverb, horizon, messenger, vite, etc.) run as systemd user services named `lerd-<worker>-<sitename>`; commands are defined per-framework in YAML; Laravel Horizon is auto-detected from `composer.json` and replaces the queue toggle when installed; Laravel ships with a `vite` host worker that runs `npm run dev` on the host via fnm for HMR (it runs `bun run dev` instead when the project uses bun or Node is unmanaged and bun is installed); workers and setup commands support optional `check` (`file` or `composer`) for conditional visibility; workers with `conflicts_with` auto-stop conflicting workers on start. Per-worker flags: `host: true` (run on host via fnm instead of in FPM container — HMR-sensitive Node tools), `per_worktree: true` (worker runs independently per worktree under `lerd-<worker>-<site>-<branch>`), `replaces_build: true` (worker provides asset manifest while running, so a worktree add skips the static `npm run build` step when this worker is opted in)
- Custom workers can be added per-project (`.lerd.yaml` `custom_workers`) or globally (`~/.config/lerd/frameworks/<name>.yaml`); use the `worker` tool's `add`/`remove` actions — both survive framework store updates
- Framework setup commands (one-off bootstrap steps like migrations, storage links) are defined in the framework YAML and shown by `framework` `action: "setup"`; Laravel has built-in storage:link/migrate/db:seed; custom frameworks can define their own
- Service version placeholders (`{{mysql_version}}`, `{{postgres_version}}`, `{{redis_version}}`, `{{meilisearch_version}}`) are available in framework env vars and resolved from the service image tag at env-setup time
- **Custom containers**: non-PHP sites (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) can define a `Containerfile.lerd` and a `container:` section in `.lerd.yaml` with a port; lerd builds a per-project image, runs it as `lerd-custom-<sitename>`, and nginx reverse-proxies to it; the project directory is volume-mounted at its host path with `--workdir` set automatically — do NOT add `WORKDIR` or `COPY` to the Containerfile; workers exec into the custom container; services are accessible by name on the shared `lerd` Podman network; **hot-reload file watchers must use polling on macOS** (inotify does not fire across Podman Machine's virtiofs mount) — nodemon: `--legacy-watch`, Vite: `server.watch.usePolling: true`, webpack: `watchOptions: { poll: 1000 }`
- **Custom-image PHP sites (custom-FPM)**: a PHP project can define a `Containerfile.lerd` (must build `FROM lerd-php<ver>-fpm:local`) plus a `container:` section with **no port**; lerd builds a per-site image (`lerd-custom-<site>:local`), runs a dedicated FPM container `lerd-cfpm-<site>`, and serves it by fastcgi instead of the shared `lerd-php<ver>-fpm`. It is a normal PHP site otherwise (xdebug, dumps, profiler, `lerd shell`, `php`/`artisan`/`composer`/`tinker`, queue/horizon all run in the per-site container). The PHP version is fixed by the `FROM` line (the UI version selector is read-only); `lerd rebuild` rebuilds the image. Same key as custom containers, the port is the discriminator: with a port it is a reverse-proxied non-PHP app, without a port it is a fastcgi PHP image. `runtime` for these reports `fpm-custom`.
- Git worktrees automatically get a `<branch>.<site>.test` subdomain (deep `*.<branch>.<site>.test` wildcard cert + nginx `server_name` on secured sites); `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `.env` are seeded from the main checkout. `.lerd.yaml` `env_overrides` declares templated env vars (`{{domain}}`, `{{scheme}}`, `{{site}}`) layered on the default `APP_URL` rewrite — for multi-tenant apps (per-branch cookies, signed-URL hosts, tenant routing)

### DNS modes

Lerd has two install-time DNS modes recorded in `~/.config/lerd/config.yaml`:
- **Managed (default)**: `dns.enabled: true`, `dns.tld: test`. Sites at `*.test` via lerd-dns + mkcert; `site` `tls_enable` works.
- **Disabled**: `dns.enabled: false`, `dns.tld: localhost`. Sites at `*.localhost` via RFC 6761; no mkcert CA, TLS toggling unavailable.

Read `diag` `action: "status"` for `dns.tld` and `dns.enabled` instead of assuming `.test`; do not propose `tls_enable` when `dns.enabled` is false.

### MCP tools

Eleven grouped tools, each selecting behaviour via `action`.

#### `site` — sites and their configuration
Actions: `list` (discover sites — CALL FIRST), `link`, `unlink`, `domain_add`, `domain_remove`, `group_assign`, `group_unassign`, `group_label`, `group_db`, `group_list`, `tls_enable`, `tls_disable`, `php`, `node`, `pause`, `unpause`, `restart`, `rebuild`, `runtime`, `nginx_read`, `nginx_write`, `nginx_reset`, `park`, `unpark`.
- `link` registers a directory; non-PHP sites need `.lerd.yaml` `container.port` + a Containerfile first, or they register as PHP (wrong)
- `domain_*` take a domain without the `.test` TLD; you can't remove the last domain
- `group_*` nest a secondary site under a main's subdomain (one level deep): they identify the secondary by `path` (defaults to cwd), not by `site`; `group_assign` with `main` + `label` (+ optional `share_db`), `group_db` = share|separate
- `php`/`node` take `version`; pass `branch` to pin the override on a worktree's checkout
- `runtime` switches `fpm` ↔ `frankenphp` (`worker: true` enables frankenphp worker mode)
- `nginx_write` saves a custom override (runs `nginx -t`, backs up, reloads); `branch` targets a worktree
- `park` registers a parent dir and auto-registers every PHP project under it; `unpark` reverses it (project files kept)

#### `service` — built-in & custom services
Actions: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `pin`, `unpin`, `update`, `rollback`, `migrate`, `remove`, `reinstall`, `add`, `expose`, `port`, `env`, `config_read`, `config_write`, `config_restore`, `config_reset`, `config_list_backups`, `preset_list`, `preset_install`, `check_updates`.
- `update` pulls a newer image (safe, in-strategy); `migrate` dumps + restores across a cross-strategy upgrade; `reinstall` with `reset_data: true` wipes data and reprovisions; `remove` with `remove_data: true` renames the data dir aside
- `stop` marks the service paused — `lerd start` skips it until started again; `pin` keeps it always running
- `add` registers a custom OCI service (`depends_on` wires dependencies, `init: true` for mysql/mariadb); prefer `preset_install` for anything in `preset_list` (phpmyadmin, pgadmin, mongo, mongo-express, selenium, stripe-mock, mysql, mariadb…)
- `env` returns the recommended `.env` connection keys; `expose` publishes an extra `host:container` port
- `port` moves the service's primary published host port (`published_port`, or `reset: true` for the default); it stays bound to 127.0.0.1, the container-internal port is unchanged, and a host-proxy site that points at the old port is realigned automatically
- `config_*` read/write/restore/reset a service's runtime tuning override

#### `db` — databases
Actions: `set`, `move`, `create`, `export`, `import`, `snapshot`, `snapshots`, `restore`, `snapshot_delete`.
- `set` picks the project DB (`database`: sqlite, mysql, postgres, or a family alternate like mariadb / postgres-pgvector / postgres-timescaledb / mysql-5-7); persists to `.lerd.yaml`, rewrites `DB_` keys, starts the service, creates the DB + `_testing`
- `move` migrates sites between two installed same-family services (`from`/`to`, `sites: [...]` or `all: true`) and repoints each `.env`; source data is left intact
- `create`/`export`/`import` auto-detect service and database; pass `service` to override
- `snapshot`/`snapshots`/`restore`/`snapshot_delete` are named, restorable snapshots (MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL); `restore` is destructive; `all_databases` covers the whole service

#### `env` — .env management
Actions: `setup`, `check`, `override`.
- `setup` configures services, DBs, APP_KEY and APP_URL; on a fresh Laravel clone call `db` `set` first to move off sqlite, then `env setup`, then ALWAYS `framework setup` or migrations never run
- `check` compares `.env` against `.env.example`
- `override` manages the personal, gitignored `.env.lerd_override` (its `set` KEY=VALUE win over lerd defaults; `LERD_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=<svc,svc>` marks vars lerd writes but won't start)

#### `runtime` — PHP/Node versions & extensions
Actions: `versions`, `node_install`, `node_uninstall`, `php_list`, `ext_list`, `ext_add`, `ext_remove`.
- `ext_add`/`ext_remove` rebuild the FPM image and restart the container (slow); `ext_add` accepts `apk_deps` for extra Alpine build packages
- **extra Alpine packages**: `lerd php:pkg add/remove/list <packages> [--php version]` (CLI) bakes runtime apk packages (CLI tools, libs) into the FPM image, saved in config under `php.packages` and re-applied on every rebuild, so they survive `php:rebuild` and base image updates. Layered onto the shared image, not the published base.
- **Pest browser testing**: `lerd pest:browser install [version]` (CLI) sets up `pestphp/pest-plugin-browser` to run inside the shared FPM container. Pest drives Playwright locally and its bundled Chromium is glibc (can't run on the container's musl), so lerd bakes Alpine's musl `chromium` into the FPM image (via the `php:pkg` package mechanism, saved under `php.packages`), persists the Playwright registry in a `/root/.cache/ms-playwright` volume, and shims Playwright's browser to exec the system chromium with `--no-sandbox`. Chromium only (no musl Firefox/WebKit); current PHP versions only, not the legacy 7.4/8.0 tier (rejected up front). `lerd pest:browser doctor [version]` checks the setup; `lerd pest:browser remove [version]` un-bakes chromium and rebuilds (the cache volume is left intact). install fails fast if the `playwright` npm package is missing, before any rebuild. Re-run install after bumping the project's Playwright version. Tests then run via the normal `lerd test`/`lerd pest`.
- **bun**: lerd never installs or version-manages bun (user installs it; `bun upgrade` self-updates). On the host, JS install/dev/build run through bun when the project is a bun project (`bun.lockb`/`bun.lock`/`bunfig.toml`/`packageManager: bun`) or when Node is unmanaged and no system Node exists but bun is present. CLI-only host toggles: `lerd node:manage` / `lerd node:unmanage` opt into/out of fnm-managed Node and regenerate host workers (bun ↔ fnm); `lerd js:runtime [bun|node|auto]` pins a single site's JS runtime in `.lerd.yaml` (the dashboard's bun/Node toggle). For an in-container bun (for `lerd shell`): `lerd php:bun install` drops a musl bun into a persistent `/root/.bun` volume that survives image rebuilds, `lerd php:bun update` upgrades it in place, `lerd php:bun version` reports it; auto-installed on `lerd link`/`setup` when host bun is present. These are CLI/host operations, not container exec actions.

#### `worker` — background workers
Actions: `list` (CALL FIRST), `start`, `stop`, `add`, `remove`, `health`, `heal`, `mode_get`, `mode_set`, and the framework workers `queue_start`, `queue_stop`, `horizon_start`, `horizon_stop`, `reverb_start`, `reverb_stop`, `schedule_start`, `schedule_stop`, `stripe_start`, `stripe_stop`, `stripe_config`.
- call `list` to discover a site's workers before `start`; pass `branch` to target a per-worktree unit
- use `horizon_*` instead of `queue_*` when laravel/horizon is installed (mutually exclusive); `queue_start` needs Redis running when `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis`
- `add` saves a custom worker to `.lerd.yaml` (or the user overlay with `global: true`); does not auto-start
- `health` lists failed units (read-only); `heal` resets and restarts them (`unit` for one, omit for all); `mode_get` reports the macOS worker runtime, `mode_set` switches it (`mode`: exec|container)
- Stripe secret is read from `.env` (STRIPE_SECRET / STRIPE_SECRET_KEY / STRIPE_API_KEY); `stripe_config` sets webhook_path / secret_env_key in `.lerd.yaml`
- **Auto-reload (CLI-only)**: `lerd horizon:reload [on|off]` and `lerd octane:reload [on|off]` (FrankenPHP worker mode) restart workers on file changes; both need the project's `chokidar` npm package
- **Idle-suspend (CLI-only)**: `lerd idle on/off` toggles activity-driven suspension globally; suspended workers stop after the idle timeout (`lerd idle timeout <dur>`) and resume on the next request/CLI/MCP/file-save. `lerd idle pin/unpin <site>` exempts a site; `lerd idle status` reports policy and last-active. A worker shown as suspended is healthy, not failed, so do not `heal` it

#### `exec` — run tooling in the PHP-FPM container
Actions: `artisan` (Laravel), `console` (other frameworks), `composer`, `vendor_bins`, `vendor_run`, `commands_list`, `commands_run`, `command_add`, `command_remove`.
- `artisan`/`console`/`composer` take `args` (array); tinker must use `--execute=<code>` for non-interactive use
- `vendor_run` is the right way to run project tooling (pest, phpunit, pint, phpstan, rector) — call `vendor_bins` first to discover what's installed, then `vendor_run` with `bin` + `args`; prefer it over `composer exec`
- `commands_*`/`command_*` list, run, add and remove the on-demand commands in a site's `.lerd.yaml` `commands:` block; `commands_run` needs `force: true` for confirm-gated commands
- **composer over git SSH (CLI-only)**: when `composer` needs a private repo reachable only over SSH, `lerd auth ssh` starts a shared ssh-agent container and loads the host's `~/.ssh/id_*` (or named keys) so passphrase-protected keys work in the FPM container; `lerd auth ssh --list` shows loaded keys, `--remove` flushes them. Keys live only in agent memory and clear on machine restart

#### `framework` — framework definitions & scaffolding
Actions: `list`, `add`, `remove`, `prune`, `search`, `install`, `project_new`, `setup`.
- `add` with `name: "laravel"` merges custom workers/setup into the built-in framework
- `remove` refuses to drop a definition a linked site still uses (pass `force: true` to override); `prune` removes every framework definition no site uses
- `search`/`install` use the community store (install auto-detects version from `composer.lock`)
- `project_new` scaffolds a new project (requires absolute `path`, default framework laravel); follow with `site` `link` + `env` `setup`
- `setup` runs the framework's post-install steps (migrations, storage:link…) — MANDATORY after `env setup` on new/cloned projects; idempotent

#### `diag` — diagnostics & observability
Actions: `status`, `doctor`, `site_doctor`, `which`, `check`, `dns_diagnose`, `bug_report`, `analyze_queries`, `dumps_recent`, `dumps_status`, `dumps_clear`, `dumps_toggle`, `profiler_toggle`, `profiler_status`, `profiler_clear`, `xdebug_on`, `xdebug_off`, `xdebug_status`.
- `status` (DNS/nginx/FPM/watcher health) and `doctor` (full JSON diagnostic) are the first stops when something is broken; `dns_diagnose` walks the DNS chain
- `site_doctor` runs framework-agnostic app-level checks for one site (env file, env drift, app key, composer/node dependency install + lock, `composer audit`/`npm audit`, PHP range, plus the framework's own checks); pass `site` (domain) or `path`, defaults to cwd
- reading logs lives in the `logs` tool (below), not here
- `which` shows resolved PHP/Node/docroot/nginx for a site; `check` validates `.lerd.yaml`
- debug bridge loop: `dumps_toggle` (enable) → `dumps_clear` → hit the page → `analyze_queries` (N+1 / slow-query report with file:line) or `dumps_recent` (filter by site/branch/ctx/kind/since/limit)
- `profiler_*` toggle the global SPX profiler and surface the flame-graph UI; `xdebug_*` control Xdebug on port 9003 (`mode` defaults to debug)
- `bug_report` writes an anonymised diagnostic report for a GitHub issue
- **disk cleanup (CLI-only)**: `lerd cleanup` reclaims podman disk from orphaned lerd images (`--dry-run` to preview, `--deep` for the aggressive tier); a daily safe-tier sweep plus post-rebuild/service-change reaping runs automatically, toggled with `lerd cleanup auto on|off|status`

#### `logs` — read logs from any source, filtered
Actions: `sources`, `fetch`. Debug without opening files by hand.
- `sources` lists every queryable source for the site plus shared infra: `app:<file>` (framework log files), `fpm`, `worker:<name>` (queue/horizon/schedule/custom), and the globals `nginx`, `dns`, `watcher`, `ui`, services, `php<ver>`. Call it first to learn the names
- `fetch source=<name>` reads one source. Filter with `grep` (regex, falls back to literal substring), `since`/`until` (relative like `15m`/`1h`/`2h30m`, or a timestamp), `level` (app logs only: error/warning/info/debug), and `lines` (default 50)
- streaming is polling: every `fetch` returns an opaque `cursor`; call again with `since=<cursor>` (or `cursor=<cursor>`) to get only the new lines. The cursor format differs per backend, so treat it as opaque and echo it back
- entries come back chronological (oldest first). Raw logs with no timestamps ignore `since`/`level` and just return the last N; a not-running container returns partial output, not an error

#### `worktree` — git worktrees
Actions: `list`, `add`, `remove`, `db_isolate`, `db_share`.
- `add` installs deps and offers an asset-worker / npm-build prompt; secured sites get `*.<branch>.<site>.test` wildcard cert SANs + nginx `server_name` automatically
- `db_isolate` gives a worktree its own database (seed via `source`: empty|main|<branch>); `db_share` points it back at the main; `remove` keeps an isolated DB unless `keep_db: false`

### Key conventions

- Pass `action` on every tool; `path` is optional on most and defaults to the directory the assistant was opened in
- Discover before acting: `site` `list` for sites, `worker` `list` for a site's workers, `service` `preset_list` before `preset_install`, `exec` `vendor_bins` before `vendor_run`
- On a fresh Laravel clone (DB_CONNECTION=sqlite), call `db` `set` before `env` `setup` to choose a database deliberately, then run `framework` `setup`
- **Domain conflicts on link**: the parked-directory watcher filters out a domain another site already owns and prints `[WARN] domain "X" already used by site "Y" — skipped`, registering the site with surviving domains (falling back to `<dirname>.<tld>`); `.lerd.yaml` is not modified. The `site` `link` and `site` `domain_add` actions instead hard-error on conflicts so you can react — read the error for the owning site name
- **Custom APP_URL**: `env` `setup` writes `<scheme>://<primary-domain>`; override via `app_url` in `.lerd.yaml` (committed) or the per-machine `sites.yaml` entry, then re-run `env setup`
- Built-in service hosts follow `lerd-<name>` (e.g. `lerd-mysql`, `lerd-redis`, `lerd-postgres`); default DB credentials are username `root`, password `lerd`
- **Custom container sites** (Node.js, Python, Go, …) — mandatory order: (1) write a Containerfile (default `Containerfile.lerd`); (2) write `.lerd.yaml` with `container: {port: <N>}` (plus optional `domains`, `services`, `secured`); (3) configure the project's `.env` with service hosts (`lerd-mysql`, etc.) and start needed services via `service` `start`; (4) call `site` `link`. Never link before steps 1–3 or the site registers as PHP-FPM; if that happens, `site` `unlink`, write the files, then link again
- Worker unit names follow `lerd-<worker>-<site>` (per-worktree: `lerd-<worker>-<site>-<branch>`)
