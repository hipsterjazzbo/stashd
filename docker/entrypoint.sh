# --workdir pointed at it instead, so the inherited cwd here is the real
# source tree, not /var/www/html -- letting dev code changes take effect on a
# plain container restart instead of a full image rebuild. In prod (no
# --workdir override), this naturally resolves to /var/www/html, unchanged.

    # in-container uid maps to an unrelated host subuid -- which can't write

    # gosu takes the raw numeric ids directly rather than a "stashd" username
    # resolved via /etc/passwd -- deliberately: a prior version remapped the

    # shadow-utils implements by recursively chowning every file already
    # owned by uid 1000 under that user's home directory (/var/www/html, the
    # full app + vendor tree). Any PUID other than the image default paid for
    # that walk on every container start, and on slower/networked storage
    # (common for NAS bind mounts) it could take minutes before the app was
    # reachable, with nothing logged in the meantime since remap ran before
    # the first log line. /var/www/html only ever needs to be *readable* at
    # runtime -- its build-time chown to stashd:stashd already leaves it
    # world-readable -- so no uid match is needed there at all; the paths
